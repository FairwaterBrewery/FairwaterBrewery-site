pageTitle: Re-starting the blog
---
I ran the original Fairwater-Brewery.co.uk site on a WordPress installation, but I was fed up of
paying quite a lot for the hosting, so I cancelled it all and let the site go dormant.  I kept
the domain name, with the intention of (eventually) resurrecting it.

Well, here we go. A new year, a new site.  This time, built using Eleventy and hosted on GitHub Pages.

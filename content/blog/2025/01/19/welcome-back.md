It's been a while since I mothballed the original Fairwater Brewery site, as I didn't want to pay for the hosting any more.

But I never really wanted to lose the site, so finally it is making its way back to life, as a static site created by Eleventy.

Actual content is to come, so far this is all about getting something up and running that looks ok, and gives me a basis to build on.

I doubt I'll be able to recreate the old posts, but I do still have all the data so I might at least upload all the old beer.xml recipes.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve uploaded all the old .BeerXml files from the original website: they can&lt;br&gt;
be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/recipelist/page-1/&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot-checking suggests that they&#39;re all working correctly, but please let me&lt;br&gt;
know if any don&#39;t work. (...which reminds me, must add some sort of &amp;quot;contact me&amp;quot; page!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I add any recipe-related blog posts I will add to them!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome back to the brewery...</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I mothballed the original Fairwater Brewery site, as I didn&#39;t want to pay for the hosting any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never really wanted to lose the site, so finally it is making its way back to life, as a static site created by Eleventy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual content is to come, so far this is all about getting something up and running that looks ok, and gives me a basis to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt I&#39;ll be able to recreate the old posts, but I do still have all the data so I might at least upload all the old beer.xml recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

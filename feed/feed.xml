    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I mothballed the original Fairwater Brewery site, as I didn&#39;t want to pay for the hosting any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never really wanted to lose the site, so finally it is making its way back to life, as a static site created by Eleventy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual content is to come, so far this is all about getting something up and running that looks ok, and gives me a basis to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt I&#39;ll be able to recreate the old posts, but I do still have all the data so I might at least upload all the old beer.xml recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

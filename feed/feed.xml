    <title>Rhubard &amp; Gooseberry Sour</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, it seems like I&#39;m still hopeless and writing new posts. Maybe I need to find something other than brewday recipe posts..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe is &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/recipes/2025-06-12-rhubard-gooseberry-sour/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for a fruited sour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends of ours have an annual party where the attendees supply mini-kegs of beer for everyone to enjoy, but since I&#39;m a brewer it seems sensible for me to bring one of my own creations! It was suggested that a sour would be popular, as they&#39;re not as easy to get hold of in mini-kegs from commercial breweries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m starting with a simple grain bill of mainly low colour Golden Promise (which is what I&#39;m tending to get by the 25kg sack as my base malt for pretty much everything), some biscuit malt (to try and get a sort of fruit crumble end result), a bit of wheat, and some acidulated malt to adjust the mash pH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water treatment is quite simple, just a bit of epsom and salt. I&#39;ll probably add a bit more salt later in the process, not to make it more like a gose, necessarily, but to help emphasise that biscuit flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put Saaz as the hop in the recipe - on brew day I might substitute, depending on what and how much I have of European hops. It&#39;s not there for flavour, just a bit of light background bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some rhubarb and gooseberries in the freezer from my in-law&#39;s garden, so those are the fruits for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to use Philly Sour, as I appreciate the simplicity. I&#39;ll start the ferment using the straight wort, and after 2 days I&#39;ll add the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll let it defrost, then probably blizt the rhubarb to get a puree, and mash the gooseberries to release their juices (I won&#39;t blitz them as I don&#39;t want to break up any seeds). Then I&#39;ll stick it all in a grain bag so I can remove it easily and won&#39;t have to fight with any bits of fruit in the lines when I rack to keg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a little shy of 2kgs of the fruit, so I&#39;m going for a 12 litre batch, though it will probably end up a bit more than that in the end because of the added liquid from the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered aging on wood to get a more complex character, but I don&#39;t really have time. I&#39;ve also considered adding a little vanilla extract to give ahint of custard, just for the whole &amp;quot;fruit crumble&amp;quot; idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it all works out as planned I should have a decent fruited sour in time for &amp;quot;Kegger 2025&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First Brew of 2025 - Theakston Old Pecuiler</title>
    <link href="https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/blog/2025/02/07/First%20brew%20of%202025%20-%20Theakston%20Old%20Pecuiler/" />

    <id>https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/blog/2025/02/07/First%20brew%20of%202025%20-%20Theakston%20Old%20Pecuiler/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My first brewday of 2025 will be this weekend - probably Sunday, as that looks to have the better weather: my brewery is in a detached garage at the bottom of our garden, and I don&#39;t like to have to walk back and forth in the rain if I can avoid it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe is &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/recipes/2025-02-07-theakston-old-pecuiler/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for a classic Old Ale: Theakson Old Pecuiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have brewed a clone of this one before, using the recipe from Graham Wheeler&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Brew Your Own British Real Ale&lt;/em&gt;, but this time it&#39;&#39;s based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themaltmiller.co.uk/product/theakstons-old-peculier-clone/&quot;&gt;this recipe from The Malt Miller site&lt;/a&gt;. The Wheeler recipe is a very basic grist, just base malt and a bit of crystal and chocolate malt, whereas the MM one is a bit more complex, with wheat to give a bit more body and head retention, and some golden syrup and black treacle, which will add some simply fermentable sugars (though I&#39;m going to use molasses rather than treacle, mainly because I have a jar already!). I&#39;m going to use some bramling cross hops, which I&#39;m hoping will add some blackcurrant notes to the beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve gone for a smack-pack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyeastlab.com/product/west-yorkshire-ale/&quot;&gt;Wyeast 1469 &amp;quot;West Yorkshire Ale&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m hoping will suit this beer. I&#39;m not prepared, either in equiment terms, or otherwise, to make a starter from a yeast slope as suggested in the MM recipe, but I wanted to use something a little more interesting than one of the dried standards like S-04, Windsor, or Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I&#39;ve often based my water treatment on the Graham Wheeler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water.html&quot;&gt;Liquor Treatment Calculator&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;m getting used to the calculator in &lt;a href=&quot;https://beersmith.com/&quot;&gt;BeerSmith3&lt;/a&gt; now, which (I belive) closely matches the suggestions from Martin Brungard&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brunwater.com/&quot;&gt;Bru&#39;n Water&lt;/a&gt;, and has the advantage over the latter of meaning that I don&#39;t need to transfer the details of the salts from the latter to the former. My initial water profile (which is in the .beerxml file for the recipe, even though I don&#39;t render it for the recipe page) is taken as far as possible from the most recent Thames Water &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thameswater.co.uk/help/water-and-waste-help/water-quality/check-your-water-quality#/results/RG53JG&quot;&gt;Water Quality Report&lt;/a&gt;, combined with a reasonable average of the hardness measurements I have taken at the start of every brewday for lots of years (using a Salifert kH Test Kit). I keep meaning to get a &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; water report done, and if I do so I&#39;ll post the results on this site!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve uploaded all the old .BeerXml files from the original website: they can&lt;br&gt;
be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/recipelist/page-1/&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot-checking suggests that they&#39;re all working correctly, but please let me&lt;br&gt;
know if any don&#39;t work. (...which reminds me, must add some sort of &amp;quot;contact me&amp;quot; page!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I add any recipe-related blog posts I will add to them!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome back to the brewery...</title>
    <link href="https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/blog/2025/01/19/welcome-back/" />
    <updated>2025-01-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://fairwater-brewery.co.uk/blog/2025/01/19/welcome-back/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I mothballed the original Fairwater Brewery site, as I didn&#39;t want to pay for the hosting any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never really wanted to lose the site, so finally it is making its way back to life, as a static site created by Eleventy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual content is to come, so far this is all about getting something up and running that looks ok, and gives me a basis to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt I&#39;ll be able to recreate the old posts, but I do still have all the data so I might at least upload all the old beer.xml recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
